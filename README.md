## Background and Setting

Cyclistic is a bike-share company in Chicago that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations, where the bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime. 

Until now, Cyclistic‚Äôs marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships.

Cyclistic‚Äôs finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Moreno (Director of Marketing) believes that maximising the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members.
<br><br>

**Customer Segmentation**

- **Casual Riders:** Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes.
- **Members Riders**: Customers who purchase annual memberships
<br>

**Key Stakeholders**

- **Lily Moreno (Director of Marketing):** Responsible for development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program.
- **Cyclistic Marketing Analytics Team:** Provides data analysis to guide Cyclistic marketing strategy.
- **Cyclistic Executive Team:** Decision maker for approval of the recommended marketing strategies.
<br>

## Objective

> ### Conduct data analysis to understand how **casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently** and devise a marketing strategy to **convert casual riders into annual members.**
 
<br>

## Dataset Information

- Data has been retrieved from [Divvy Bikes](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html)
- Data was downloaded from the [repository](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) in the form of 12 CSV files, each file corresponds to the records of a month in the year 2022.
- The data used for this analysis covers a 12-Month period from January 2022 to December 2022, with 5667717 total rows.
<br>

## **Data Limitations**

**Due to privacy-related issues, no personally identifiable information will be used.**

- Won‚Äôt be able to connect pass purchases to credit card numbers to determine if casual riders live in the Cyclistic service area or if they have purchased multiple single passes.
<br>

**Missing values: Removed to ensure accurate analysis and facilitate effective decision making.**

- There were missing values in the fields *start_station_name, start_station_id, end_station_name, end_station_id, end_lat, end_lng*.
- 1298357 rows were deleted.
<br>

**Inaccurate Data: Ride duration values that are negative or zero have been excluded, as they are not logically meaningful.**

- 76651 rows were deleted.
<br>

**Outliers: To note where riders may have forgotten to return their bikes as the ride duration is 24 hours and longer.**

- ride_length ‚â• 24 hours: 156
- ride_length ‚â• 48 hours: 36
<br>

## Data Cleaning and Analysis

Data cleaning and analysis were done on **MySQL** after importing 12 CSV file for the year 2022 and visualisations were done on **Tableau Public**. 

‚≠ê¬†SQL query used can be found [here](https://github.com/cwanyan/SQLproject/blob/main/Cyclistic_SQL.sql). 

‚≠ê¬†Table output for visualisation can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pJS-KF7w5gy8QdZDh1H6H06wMgIhuypHOHbP0HyBclE/edit?usp=sharing).

## Key Findings

![1  Total Ride Share](https://github.com/cwanyan/SQL-Project/assets/141533132/bf4b92a3-4fa4-4bdc-bc06-5c1ffac0ad13)


59.67% of the participants are member riders, while 40.33% are casual riders.
<br><br>


![2  No  of Trips by Quarter](https://github.com/cwanyan/SQL-Project/assets/141533132/1a4d7271-c30b-43d7-bfb5-c450e45eb4d8)


Both member and casual riders follow the same trend for seasonality where it peaked in Q3 and Q2. This can be due to the ideal weather in Spring and Summer for bike rides. There‚Äôs a drop in Q4 when there is a transition to colder months while winter months in Q1 record the lowest number of trips. 
<br><br>


![3  No  of Trips by Month](https://github.com/cwanyan/SQL-Project/assets/141533132/9c6b06b7-7a6b-4625-b9aa-25a6541da634)


During the winter months (January to December), casual riders consistently show significantly lower trip numbers compared to member riders. This disparity continues during the transitional months of March, April, September, October, and November.

However, as the weather improves during the summer months (May to August), the trip numbers for casual riders begin to closely match those of member riders. 

The data indicates that the warmer seasons see a significant increase in casual rider activity, resulting in trip numbers that are nearly on par with member riders.

**Refer to appendix A for Chicago weather by month*
<br><br>


![4  No  of Trips by Day of Week](https://github.com/cwanyan/SQL-Project/assets/141533132/3e429709-43fb-4284-8954-f76cf2ac3109)


Casual riders show a U-shaped trend, with much lower bike usage on weekdays and peak during weekends. Member riders exhibit an inverted U-shaped pattern, with fewer trips on weekends and increased usage during midweek. 

These findings suggest different usage behaviours, with casual riders using bikes more for leisure on weekends, and member riders utilising bikes for regular commuting, particularly during the weekdays.
<br><br>


![5  No  of Trips by Hour](https://github.com/cwanyan/SQL-Project/assets/141533132/561da13c-c422-4097-8dcb-bec6f59c6ff0)


For member riders, there is a an increase in bike usage starting from 4 am, with two prominent peaks at 8 am and 5 pm, likely corresponding to morning and evening commutes.

Casual riders also show a gradual increase from 4am and reaching a peak at 5 pm, indicating a preference for late-afternoon rides. 

Both rider types experience a steady decline after the 5 pm peak, suggesting reduced bike usage during the later hours of the day.
<br><br>


![6  Rideable Type](https://github.com/cwanyan/SQL-Project/assets/141533132/d514b566-c1d4-4096-a647-0d60105fd99d)


Classic bikes are the most popular among both types of riders, with electric bikes coming in as the second most used option. Docked bikes are primarily utilised by casual riders, whereas member riders tend not to use them.
<br><br>


![8  Average Ride Duration](https://github.com/cwanyan/SQL-Project/assets/141533132/814be714-1451-45f2-8b13-a7ac9e9c9b71)


Casual riders' average ride duration is approximately 24 minutes, while member riders' average ride duration is nearly half of that at 12 minutes.
<br><br>


![9  Average Ride Duration by Day of Week](https://github.com/cwanyan/SQL-Project/assets/141533132/0b42a2ef-7dc9-4f16-88fc-43debbcd2e8e)


The average ride duration for casual riders follows a U-shaped pattern, reaching its lowest point during the middle of the week. In contrast, member riders experience consistent ride durations, with a slight increase on weekends. Overall, the average ride duration for casual riders exceeds that of member riders on all days.
<br><br>


![17  Top 10 Start Stations](https://github.com/cwanyan/SQL-Project/assets/141533132/41432897-5d21-4aa9-b617-60863a1db2a8)

![18  Top 10 End Stations](https://github.com/cwanyan/SQL-Project/assets/141533132/02340639-43b1-4617-b787-edce6f834a52)

Casual riders tend to prefer popular tourist and recreational destinations, such as Streeter Dr & Grand Ave, Millennium Park, and the Shedd Aquarium, for both starting and ending their rides. On the other hand, members frequently utilise stations located near residential and business areas, such as Kingsbury St & Kinzie St and Wells St & Concord Ln, indicating their preference for commuting and daily use. 

The difference in station preferences suggests that casual riders often seek leisure rides, while members exhibit a more consistent and utilitarian riding behaviour, reflecting the potential for targeted marketing efforts to convert casual riders into annual members.
